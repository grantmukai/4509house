                        I enjoy what I do. I am proud of what I do. And I cannot do just half, three-quarters or nine-tenths of something. If I am going to start a project, I finish it.

                                As a journalism major, I know how to write well for both print and online publications. I have used my writing abilities to report the news and also to promote businesses in the marketing space.

                                In my reporter days, I worked as a television producer and video editor. I created my own stories from start to finish and designed my own special effects.

                                By understanding that email design is not the same as Web design, I am proficient in coding &ldquo;depricated&rdquo; HTML and inline CSS as well as having a good idea of what Outlook does and does not support. I also understand how to best design emails to increase click rates.

                                I am very serious about only writing the cleanest up-to-date HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7. My code is properly indented and follows standards set by the W3C and Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

                                I have used a variety of content management systems ranging from Drupal to WordPress multi-site installations running Commons in a Box and BuddyPress. Since I worked for a membership association, I also have knowledge of Association Membership Systems and how those integreate into member databases.

                                 At my current job, I manage the transition of our website which comprises contract negotiations and working with other departments. I know how to advance projects to meet deadlines and keep everything on track.

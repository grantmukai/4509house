                        I enjoy what I do. I am proud of what I do. And I cannot do just half, three-quarters or nine-tenths of something. If I am going to start a project, I finish it.

                                As a journalism major, I know how to write well for both print and online publications. I have used my writing abilities to report the news and also to promote businesses in the marketing space.

                                In my reporter days, I worked as a television producer and video editor. I created my own stories from start to finish and designed my own special effects.

                                By understanding that email design is not the same as Web design, I am proficient in writing email newsletters. I understand how to organize important information so that everything displays correctly.

                                After having worked with many different Web content management systems such as WordPress, Drupal and DotNetNuke, I can say that I know how to organize and manage front-end appearances as well as the databases necessary to run the entire site.

                                Digital strategy is the core of my responsibilities at APS. And at Project HOPE, my goal was to conceptualize a strategy that could bring together communications, fundraising efforts and marketing initiatives to present a united front for the Web presence.

                                 Throughout my career, I've managed several website transitions which comprise contract negotiations and working with other departments. I know how to advance projects to meet deadlines and keep everything on track.

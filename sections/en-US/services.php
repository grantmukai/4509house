                        I enjoy what I do. I am proud of what I do. And I cannot do just half, three-quarters or nine-tenths of something. If I am going to start a project, I finish it.

                                As a journalism major, I know how to write well for both print and online publications. I have used my writing abilities to report the news and also to promote businesses in the marketing space.

                            <p class="text-grey">
                                In my reporter days, I worked as a television producer and video editor. I created my own stories from start to finish and designed my own special effects.

                                By understanding that email design is not the same as Web design, I am proficient in coding &ldquo;depricated&rdquo; HTML and inline CSS as well as having a good idea of what Outlook does and does not support.

                                I am very serious about only writing the cleanest up-to-date HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7. My code is properly indented and follows standards set by the W3C and Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

                                Not only do I understand how to implement media queries and float and scale content for responsive Web design, I also undestand best practices for creating responsive email (where supported).

                                Although I provide Web services for my association, I also offer training to our staff on how to manage their own content and assist our members in English, French and Spanish with membership issues.

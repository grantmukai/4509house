                        I enjoy what I do. I am proud of what I do. And I cannot do just half, three-quarters or nine-tenths of something. If I am going to start a project, I finish it.

                                As a journalism major, I know how to write well for both print and online publications. I have used my writing abilities to report the news and also to promote businesses in the marketing space.

                                In my former days, I worked as a television reporter and video editor. I produced my own stories from start to finish and created my own special effects.

                                Understanding that email design is not the same as Web design, I am proficient in coding &ldquo;depricated&rdquo; HTML and inline CSS as well as having a good idea of what Outlook does and does not support.

                                I am very serious about only writing the cleanest up-to-date HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7. My code is properly indented and follows standards set by the W3C.

                                I have used several different content management systems ranging from Drupal to WordPress to DotNetNuke. As much of my experience has been working for a membership assoication, I also understand association management systems and how they integrate with member databases.

                                Currently, I am leading a website migration with Project HOPE where I negotiate design and content creation with our contractor and work with our internal teams to create and migrate content.

                        I enjoy what I do. I am proud of what I do. And I cannot do just half, three-quarters or nine-tenths of something. If I am going to start a project, I finish it.

                                As a journalism major, I know how to write well for both print and online publications. I have used my writing abilities to report the news and also to promote businesses in the marketing space.

                                In my former days, I worked as a television reporter and video editor. I produced my own stories from start to finish and created my own special effects.

                                By understanding that email design is not the same as Web design, I am proficient in writing email newsletters. I understand how to organise important information so that everything displays correctly.

                                After having worked with many different Web content management systems such as WordPress, Drupal and DotNetNuke, I can say that I know how to organise and manage front-end appearances as well as the databases necessary to run the entire site.

                                Digital strategy is the core of my responsibilities at Project HOPE. My goal is to conceptualise a strategy that brings together our communications, our fundraising efforts and our marketing initiatives to present a united front for our Web presence.

                                Currently, I am leading a website migration with Project HOPE where I negotiate design and content creation with our contractor and work with our internal teams to create and migrate content.
